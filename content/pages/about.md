I'm a software developer, at present living in Berlin.
I work mostly with Python and JavaScript,
but I used to tamper with Java and C++,
and I'm currently improving GDScript skills.
I'm a huge fan of automated tests, open source, refactoring, game development,
and removing third party services from my life.

In 2018 I've established a small game development company: [Miskatonic Studio](https://miskatonicstudio.com) and released my first game: [Intrepid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/992860/Intrepid).
