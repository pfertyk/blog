Hi! My name is Paweł Fertyk.
I'm a Polish software developer, presently living in Belgium.
I'm a huge fan of Linux, open source,
and removing third party services from my life.

Over the years, I've worked with Python, GDScript, JavaScript, git,
AWS, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Celery, GitHub Actions, Travis CI, Jenkins,
Postgres, Django, Flask, Angular, React Native, WebRTC, WebSockets, Selenium, Cucumber,
as well as Java and C++ (in the old days) and a few other technologies.
The list of projects below should provide a glimpse.

I dabble in game development as well: as [Miskatonic Studio](https://miskatonicstudio.com) I've released [Intrepid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/992860/Intrepid), [Arboretum](https://miskatonicstudio.itch.io/arboretum), [Hexpanse](https://hexpanse.miskatonicstudio.com/), and a few [other projects](https://github.com/miskatonicstudio).
